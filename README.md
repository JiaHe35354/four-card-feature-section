## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Using CSS Grid to layout the card container and place each card in its designated grid area

- Using align-self to align individual elements within a Flexbox container

- Applying margin-top: auto in a column-based Flexbox (flex-direction: column) to push an element to the bottom of the container

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```css
footer {
  margin-top: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to explore more layout and responsive design using CSS Grid in the future.
